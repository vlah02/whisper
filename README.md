## 🌐 Network Topology Example

```
alice ←→ bob ←→ charlie ←→ steven
```

**Alice's view:**
- **Directly connected**: `[bob]`
- **Reachable via routing**: 
  - `alice -> bob -> charlie`
  - `alice -> bob -> charlie -> steven`

**Message flow**: When alice sends `/msg steven hello`, the message routes:
`alice → bob → charlie → steven`

## 🎯 Message Types & Display

### Message Labels & Security Status
**Encrypted Messages (when secure sessions exist):**
- `[SECURE-MESSAGE]` - End-to-end encrypted direct message
- `[SECURE-ROUTED]` - End-to-end encrypted multi-hop message
- `[SECURE-LOCALCAST]` - Encrypted broadcast to direct connections
- `[SECURE-BROADCAST]` - Encrypted network-wide broadcast

**Fallback Messages (when no secure session available):**
- `[MESSAGE]` - Plaintext direct message (fallback)
- `[ROUTED]` - Plaintext multi-hop message (fallback)
- `[LOCALCAST]` - Plaintext local broadcast (fallback)  
- `[BROADCAST]` - Plaintext network broadcast (fallback)

   # Steven receives: "15:04:05 [ROUTED] alice: Hello from the other end!"
   ```

4. **Test encrypted broadcasts**:
   ```
   alice: /broadcast Network announcement!
   # Users with sessions receive: "15:04:10 [SECURE-BROADCAST] alice: Network announcement!"
   # Users without sessions receive: "15:04:10 [BROADCAST] alice: Network announcement!"
   
   bob: /localcast Local update  
   # alice and charlie receive: "15:04:15 [SECURE-LOCALCAST] bob: Local update"
   ```

5. **Check security status**:

   alice: /security
   # Shows active encrypted sessions and key fingerprints
   ```

## 🔒 Comprehensive Encryption Architecture

### 🛡️ Cryptographic Foundation

**Whisper implements military-grade end-to-end encryption** using proven cryptographic primitives:

- **🔑 Identity System**: Ed25519 elliptic curve digital signatures (32-byte keys)
- **🤝 Key Exchange**: Curve25519 Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)
- **🔐 Symmetric Encryption**: AES-256-GCM with random nonces
- **🔗 Key Derivation**: HKDF-SHA256 for perfect forward secrecy
- **📦 Message Authentication**: Built-in GCM authentication tags

### 🔐 Message-Type Specific Encryption

#### **Direct Messages (`/msg [user] [message]`)**
```
Alice → Bob: "Hello Bob!"

🔒 Security Process:
1. Alice generates Ed25519 identity keypair on startup
2. Alice requests Bob's public key through network routing
3. Curve25519 ECDH generates shared secret: Alice_private × Bob_public
4. HKDF derives unique AES-256 session key from shared secret
5. Message encrypted with AES-GCM + random 12-byte nonce
6. Encrypted payload sent through WebRTC data channel
7. Bob decrypts using same derived session key

📨 Bob receives: [SECURE-MESSAGE] alice: Hello Bob!
```

#### **Multi-Hop Routed Messages (`alice → bob → charlie`)**
```
Alice → Charlie (via Bob): "Hi Charlie!"

🔒 Security Process:
1. Alice establishes SEPARATE session keys with BOTH Bob and Charlie
2. Message encrypted ONLY for Charlie (end-to-end encryption)
3. Bob forwards encrypted payload without decrypting
4. Only Charlie can decrypt the message
5. Routing information remains separate from encrypted content

📨 Charlie receives: [SECURE-ROUTED] alice: Hi Charlie!
📨 Bob sees: Encrypted routing packet (cannot read message content)
```

#### **Local Broadcasts (`/localcast [message]`)**
```
Alice → [Bob, Charlie]: "Local announcement"

🔒 Security Process:
1. Alice maintains separate session keys with each direct peer
2. Message encrypted individually for each connected peer
3. Each peer receives their own encrypted copy
4. No peer can decrypt messages intended for others

📨 Bob receives: [SECURE-LOCALCAST] alice: Local announcement
📨 Charlie receives: [SECURE-LOCALCAST] alice: Local announcement
```

#### **Network Broadcasts (`/broadcast [message]`)**
```
Network: alice ←→ bob ←→ charlie ←→ steven
Alice broadcasts: "Global announcement"

🔒 Security Process:

For DIRECT connections (Alice → Bob):
1. Encrypt with Alice-Bob session key
2. Send directly via WebRTC data channel
📨 Bob receives: [SECURE-BROADCAST] alice: Global announcement

For ROUTED connections (Alice → Charlie, Alice → Steven):
1. Encrypt with Alice-Charlie session key (separate from Bob)
2. Send via routing: Alice → Bob → Charlie
3. Bob forwards encrypted packet (cannot decrypt)
4. Charlie decrypts with Alice-Charlie session key
📨 Charlie receives: [SECURE-BROADCAST] alice: Global announcement

For users WITHOUT sessions:
📨 David receives: [BROADCAST] alice: Global announcement (plaintext fallback)
```

### 🔐 Advanced Security Features

#### **Perfect Forward Secrecy**
- Each peer pair uses **unique session keys** derived from ECDH
- Keys never transmitted over network
- Compromise of one session doesn't affect others
- Session keys destroyed when connections close

#### **Automatic Key Discovery & Exchange**
```
Alice wants to message Steven (not directly connected):

1. Alice → Bob: "REQUEST_PUBLIC_KEY for steven"
2. Bob → Charlie: "REQUEST_PUBLIC_KEY for steven" 
3. Charlie → Steven: "REQUEST_PUBLIC_KEY for steven"
4. Steven → Charlie: "PUBLIC_KEY_RESPONSE: [steven's Ed25519 public key]"
5. Charlie → Bob: forwards response
6. Bob → Alice: forwards response
7. Alice derives session key: Alice_private × Steven_public
8. Steven derives same key: Steven_private × Alice_public
9. Bidirectional encrypted communication established

🔒 Result: Alice ←→ Steven secure session (via routing)
```

#### **Cryptographic Identity Verification**
```
User Registration Process:
1. Generate Ed25519 keypair (private/public)
2. Create fingerprint: first 16 chars of base64(public_key)
3. Sign all messages with private key
4. Recipients verify signatures with public key

Alice's Identity:
- Ed25519 Private Key: [32 bytes, never transmitted]
- Ed25519 Public Key: [32 bytes, shared with network]
- Fingerprint: "dMTdV9gRUlXw" (displayed to users)
```

#### **Message Authentication & Integrity**
- Every encrypted message includes **GCM authentication tag**
- Recipients verify message hasn't been tampered with
- Invalid/corrupted messages automatically rejected
- Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks on routing nodes

### 🛡️ Security Guarantees

✅ **End-to-End Encryption**: Only sender and intended recipient can read messages  
✅ **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Past messages remain secure even if keys compromised  
✅ **Message Authentication**: Cryptographic proof of sender identity  
✅ **Replay Protection**: Unique nonces prevent message replay attacks  
✅ **Route Security**: Intermediate nodes cannot decrypt forwarded messages  
✅ **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: No central server stores keys or plaintext  
✅ **Automatic Fallback**: Graceful degradation to plaintext when encryption unavailable  

### 🔄 Session Management

#### **Session Lifecycle**
1. **Discovery**: Find user's public key through network routing
2. **Key Exchange**: Perform Curve25519 ECDH key agreement  
3. **Derivation**: Generate unique AES-256 session key with HKDF
4. **Bidirectional Setup**: Ensure both parties have session keys
5. **Encrypted Communication**: All messages encrypted with AES-GCM
6. **Session Cleanup**: Keys destroyed when connection closes

#### **Session Status Display (`/security` command)**
```
🔐 Security Status for alice:
Identity: dMTdV9gRUlXw (Ed25519)
Active Sessions: 3

✅ bob (direct) - AES-256-GCM session active
✅ charlie (routed via bob) - AES-256-GCM session active  
✅ steven (routed via bob→charlie) - AES-256-GCM session active
❌ david - No secure session (plaintext fallback)
```

3. **Route Propagation**: Network topology updates propagate through all connections
4. **Message Forwarding**: Messages automatically route through optimal paths
5. **Connection Management**: Routes update automatically when connections change

### Network Discovery Process
1. **Initial Connection**: `alice ←→ bob` (direct connection established)
2. **Network Expansion**: `bob ←→ charlie` (bob learns charlie, tells alice)
3. **Full Discovery**: `charlie ←→ steven` (charlie learns steven, tells bob, bob tells alice)
4. **Complete Topology**: All nodes know complete network structure
